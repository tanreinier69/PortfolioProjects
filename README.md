# SQL-Data-Exploration-Portfolio

The purpose of this SQL query is to give a on-site analysis of the dataset at hand and demonstrate ability to create queries and navigate through a database.
I used COVID-19 Mortality as my dataset, which can be retrieved here: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

PostgreSQL was used as the main query platform.
